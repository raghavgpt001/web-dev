<div class="phy">
<h2>Physics</h2>
<p>Concepts in physics are very general, thus allowing one to describe a wide range of phenomena with a very small number of equations.
That is why I love Physics. I love exploring different fields in this subject.My perspective has completely changed after I started studying it in the way I do now.<br>I also made a detailed report on STR this summer for SoS.
